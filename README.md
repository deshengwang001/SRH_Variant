# SRH_Variant
Pitch estimation method

This code is a variant of the following approach.
T.Drugman, A.Alwan, "Joint Robust Voicing Detection and Pitch Estimation
Based on Residual Harmonics", Interspeech11, Firenze, Italy, 2011

We modify the SRH formula and add the pitch segment expansion operation.
We acknowledge the authors for the origional SRH codes, 
some of which serves as a starting point for this code.

Matlab version used for developing this code: 2019a
